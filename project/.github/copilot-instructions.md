# GitHub Copilot instructions — inventory project

This file gives AI agents concise, actionable guidance for working productively in this Spring Boot + JSP inventory project.

- **Repo summary:** Spring Boot web application packaged as a single JAR. Main entry: `src/main/java/com/example/ProjectApplication.java`. Frontend uses JSPs (`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views`) and static assets (`src/main/resources/static`). Controllers live in `src/main/java/com/example/controller`. Chat-related code is under `src/main/java/com/example/chat` (STOMP/WebSocket patterns).

- **Build & run (Windows):** use the Maven wrapper shipped with the repo.
  - Build: `.
mvnw.cmd clean package` (or `.
mvnw.cmd -DskipTests package` for faster builds)
  - Run: `java -jar target/project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` or `.
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`
  - Run tests: `.
mvnw.cmd test`

- **Where to change things:**
  - Java sources: `src/main/java/com/example/...`
  - Spring Boot config: `src/main/resources/application.properties` (check port, datasource, feature flags).
  - Static assets (CSS/JS/images): `src/main/resources/static/` (these are served at `/`).
  - JSP views: `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/*.jsp` (controllers return view names matching these files).
  - Do NOT edit files under `target/` — they are generated by the build.

- **Project-specific patterns & examples:**
  - Controllers follow a package-level organization under `controller`. They typically return JSP view names (e.g., return `"detail"` -> `detail.jsp` in `WEB-INF/views`). When adding a new page add both a controller mapping and a JSP.
  - Chat and real-time features use STOMP/WebSocket (see `com.example.chat` and test artifacts in `target/surefire-reports`). Inspect `StompClientTest.txt` in `target/surefire-reports` for examples of client usage.
  - Static assets are duplicated into `target/` during build; edit the source files in `src/main/resources/static` (not `target/`).

- **Tests & CI notes:**
  - Unit/integration tests are executed by Maven Surefire; results are in `target/surefire-reports/` (XML and `.dumpstream`). Use `.
mvnw.cmd -Dtest=FullyQualifiedTestName test` to run a single test class.

- **Editing / debugging tips:**
  - For quick dev iteration run `.
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` and modify Java/JSPs in the source tree. Some static changes are picked up immediately; JSP changes typically require restart or IDE hot-swap depending on setup.
  - To run from an IDE, run the `ProjectApplication` main method. Breakpoints in controllers and config classes will be hit when requests are served.

- **Dependency & integration checks:**
  - Inspect `pom.xml` for external libraries (websocket, mail, template libs). If adding dependencies, prefer adding them to `pom.xml` and using the wrapper for reproducible builds.

- **PR / code-style conventions (discoverable):**
  - Follow the existing package structure (`com.example.*`). Place tests under `src/test/java/...` matching package names.
  - Keep controller logic thin; business logic belongs in services (look for `service` package if added). Prefer small, focused changes and run `.
mvnw.cmd test` before opening a PR.

- **When generating code or edits, include these examples:**
  - Adding a controller mapping:
    - File: `src/main/java/com/example/controller/MyController.java`
    - Return a JSP named `myview` -> create `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/myview.jsp` and add assets under `src/main/resources/static/`.

- **Common pitfalls to avoid:**
  - Editing `target/` files directly.
  - Forgetting to update `application.properties` for environment-specific values.
